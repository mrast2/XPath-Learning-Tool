# XPath-Learning-Tool
This tool has been created to educate a user about the XPaths in an XML file. For a selected XML file, the tool dynamically creates XPaths using recursion and dynamically binds it to a ComboBox.
A user can select an XPath from the ComboBox and get the resulting XML nodes corresponding to that XPath.

In this way, a user gets to know about all the type of XPaths possible for any XML and also the resultant nodes of XPaths. A user can see the xml structure in right besides the result and compare it to learn.
